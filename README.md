## Description

This program is a tech blog that allows you to create an account

on this website for tech-related stuff. You can create an account,

view your home page, and crate/edit/delete posts of your very own.


## Usage

The usage of this program is to have your very own blog/forum 

dedicated to discussing anything tech related. It's secured via

username and password and you can very easily create a new one

if necessary.

## Status

The status of this program is not applicable because I couldn't

get it to post to heroku. I did a lot of work on this project

and wanted to get it submitted no matter how good or bad, as I

did not want to leave an assignment blank. I feel like I am not

very far off from getting it properly deployed but with upcoming

homework and other things I felt the need to just submit it the way

it is
