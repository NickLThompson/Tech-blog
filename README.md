## Description

This program is a tech blog that allows you to create an account

on this website for tech-related stuff. You can create an account,

view your home page, and crate/edit/delete posts of your very own.


## Usage

The usage of this program is to have your very own blog/forum 

dedicated to discussing anything tech related. It's secured via

username and password and you can very easily create a new one

if necessary.
